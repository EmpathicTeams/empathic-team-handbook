# Empathic Team Handbook

[![empathic: involving, characterized by, or based on empathy.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Empathic Team Handbook.

This is a living document which can and should change over time to reflect the needs and expectations of the team members.

The "team" is any group of people which work and socialize together towards common goals.

Please read the document before contributing.

## Why do we join the team?

We join the team to share our work, to learn from each other, to befriend one another, and to create the world we would like to live in every day — to create a kind, generous, respectful, creative, and passionate community. We also have an opportunity to be our most generous selves — engaging in the daily work of servicing our clients and each other, checking our egos at the door, recognizing the divine spark within others, fostering creativity and well-being in others, and sharing what we most authentically can offer.

## Sounds great, how do you do it?

In order for this work of creating community to flourish, it is necessary to establish certain boundaries. These boundaries are not meant to curtail individual freedoms or to spoil anyone’s fun. Rather, they are self-preserving and community-preserving. To put it simply, we forefront the practice of empathy.

## What is empthy?

Empathy is the skill of being able to understand, feel and act based on what another person is experiencing, from within their frame of reference. Definitions of empathy vary and encompass a broad range of emotional states and responses.
