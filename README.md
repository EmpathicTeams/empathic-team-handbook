# Empathic Team Handbook

[![empathic: involving, characterized by, or based on empathy. Joseph Alper: "It is also during early childhood that people begin experiencing empathic guilt—feeling distress when they have been the cause of someone else's discomfort."](./empathic.png)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empathic)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Empathic Team Handbook.



This is a living document which can and should change over time to reflect the needs and expectations of the team members. The "team" is any group of people which work and socialize together towards common goals.

Please read the document before contributing.

## Why do we join the team?

We join the team to share our work, to learn from each other, to befriend one another, and to create the world we would like to live in every day — to create a kind, generous, respectful, creative, and passionate community. We also have an opportunity to be our most generous selves — engaging in the daily work of servicing our clients and each other, checking our egos at the door, recognizing the divine spark within others, fostering creativity and well-being in others, and sharing what we most authentically can offer.

## Sounds great, how do you do it?

In order for this work of creating community to flourish, it is necessary to establish certain boundaries. These boundaries are not meant to curtail individual freedoms or to spoil anyone’s fun. Rather, they are self-preserving and community-preserving. To put it simply, we forefront the practice of empathy.

## What is empthy?

Empathy is the skill of being able to understand, feel and act based on what another person is experiencing, from within their frame of reference. Definitions of empathy vary and encompass a broad range of emotional states and responses.

## Can I learn to be more empathic?

As for any other skill, for some people being empathic comes naturally and for others it takes a bit more work. We welcome people of all Empathy skill levels to our team!

## How does it feel to work for an empathic team?

> I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit - the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes; to see the world through the eyes of those who are different from us - the child who's hungry, the steelworker who's been laid off, the family who lost the entire life they built together when the storm came to town. When you think like this, when you choose to broaden your ambit of concern and empathise with the plight of others, whether they are close friends or distant strangers; it becomes harder not to act; harder not to help.

-- Barack Hussein Obama, 2006

Think about how the above quote, the source of the quote and the photo make you feel and how it might make other people feel. Think about what kind of feelings you feel when you see this photo of Barack Obama and what kind of feeling people from the opposing political camp may feel.

In most companies, especially in The USA, it would be forbidden and considered politically inappropriate to share a potentially politically divisive image in the workplace. On the contrary, in our team we encourege you to be creative and bold, and not to be afraid expressing yourself due to political correctness.

There is a caveat however - that we do all such actions in an empathic way.

To get a better feeling for this process, put yourself in the shoes of an employee which works for a company where most employees hold opposing political views to his own -

---
 
The company fosters an open, friendly, vibrant environment in the workplace and naturally you feel free to discuss political or divisive issues (otherwise, what will we to talk about, our feelings..?). You loves being part of this friendly, open community and feel like you are helping to represent your political position and maybe even convince some people to change the way they feel about it.

When a new manager joins your team, you feel good and excited to discover what he thinks about your views. You see it as an opportunity to use your experience to get another person to change their mind about it. Over time, however, you feel like you are not getting through and not sure why. Maybe you lost your "touch"? Maybe something in your personal life is intrefering with your skills? Whatever the reason, you notice that the arguments leave you with a bad feeling, but you are not quite sure why or what the source of this feeling is.

Eventually, the manager confronts you about it. He says that he wants to support the kind of open, friendly environment we foster at our company and does not like to leave conflicts unresolved. Personally, he likes having the kind of political arguments we are having but if you feel like it's preventing you from focusing on your work he will inform all employees to refrain from such discussions at the workplace. You are geniuinely touched by the manager's action and feel like you got him all wrong, maybe you just lost your confidence and the bad feeling you felt was not related to him at all. You are still feeling this feeling even as you talk to the manager now, but not being able to define it even to yourself, there is no point mentioning it. You thank the manager for confronting you about it, and tell him that you are used to these kind of political arguments, and jokingly tell him that you dealt with much more hardcore opposition then him.

You continue your political arguments, but the bad feeling remains. You notice that you withdraw from the arguments quicker, and at times you jokingly say that maybe you'll move to the other political side just so they leave you alone, but, you immediately follow up with, just joking, I'll change your minds eventually. When an employee is promoted, you can't help but wonder if your political views had any effect on this decision. This begins to harm both your professional and personal confidence. 

Eventually, people notice a degredation in your work and personal relationships with fellow employees and you are invited to a talk with the Human Resources manager. He is very honest and open and you feel comfortable sharing your feelings with him. He makes you feel much better and you feel like this was just a small setback, and with his and the company's support you will surely overcome this. The HR manager asks what actions they should take to prevent your negative feelings in the future. You admit that the political arguments are starting the be a source of anxiety and stress for you and you imagine for others as well and that maybe it's best to forbid them as your manager suggested.

At first you feel good and able to focus on your work now that the arguments stopped. However, over time you notice the "bad feeling" returns. You still feel like maybe you should drop the political ideology as it prevents your promotion. Fellow employees still post their views which anger and disgust you over social media. Occassionaly you will notice the discussion stops as you walk into a room.
